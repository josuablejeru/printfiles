# Desktop App for Managing Gcode Files and STL/3MF Files
This is a desktop application designed to help you manage your Gcode files and STL/3MF files for your 3D printing projects. With this app, you can easily organize and keep track of all your files, as well as incorporate photos and filament information. In the future, we plan to add a filament tracker and other useful features to make the 3D printing process even easier.
